    <b>Revision date October 27, 2016</b><br><br>

    <b>Effective date May 16, 2008</b><br><br> Welcome to RareShare.org ("RG Patient’s App")! We are built on a premise that sharing information is good, especially when it comes to information about rare diseases. The more you share the more you have an opportunity
    to help others whose lives have been touched by rare disease. Since rare diseases are not common, they are also often not well understood. By joining our community of support and sharing information about your experience, you will help others, including
    researchers, better understand your disease.<br><br> Below are the Terms of Service, and in the right column, you will find a summary that will help you understand these terms, although the summary is not legally binding.<br><br> The following terms
    constitute an agreement between you and Rare Genomics Institute, Inc. (“Rare Genomics” or “we” or “us”) the operator of RareShare. RareShare, described below, provides users with a wide array of services including, without limitation, news, reference
    resources, personalized content, and communication platforms (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are provided to users of RareShare subject to the following Terms of Service (the "Terms"), the most current version of which is located at the
    bottom of any page of RareShare. By using the Services, you the user (“user” or “you”) agree to these Terms, whether or not you are a registered member of RareShare or just a casual visitor. These Terms govern your use of the Services and create a
    binding legal agreement that we may enforce against you in the event of a violation. If you do not agree to all of these Terms of Service, do not use the Services. To the extent you register with RareShare as a member, then in addition to the terms
